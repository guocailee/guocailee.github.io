最近我经常在思考一个问题(灵感来源一个[讨论](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/193-the-state-of-front-end-dev-ala-rebroadcast/)) ：做一个前端开发者，应该关心什么？ 在通常的感觉中，前端开发处于一个中间的位置 。每个一个团队的人，都需要跟前端开发打交道. 因为，前端开发是创造真正跟用户交互的职位，很多都需要前端开发进行处理。这也许是为何前端开发如此有趣的原因。

因为前端开发处于中间位置，并且需要跟许多人与工作打交道。如果前端关注以下技能，那么在开发时，就更能胜任工作，并将工作任务处理得更好.


前端开发应该关注设计， 如果他本身不是设计师，那么他不会知道设计的重要性. They have good taste in design. They know about the tools involved. They know where the design role fits into the process.

前端开发应该关注后端. If they aren't a back end coder themselves, they know how important the back end is. They know what the back end is capable of delivering and what it isn't. They know the responsibilities back end developers have. They know the languages involved. They know how to ask for what they need on the front end.

前端开发应该关注网络. They know that websites are delivered over the internet, a network, and that that network is a wild and sometimes unpredictable place. They know networks can be on or off, fast or slow, and reliable or unreliable.

前端开发应该关注性能. If they aren't entirely performance focused themselves, they know that performance is vital to a website's success. They know performance is a complex world onto itself. They know there are quick wins and long term struggles. They know that so long as the back end is fast, the other 80% of the time a website is loading is a front end concern.

前端开发应该关注内容策划. If they aren't a content strategist themselves, they know that websites live and die by the content on them. They know that the lack of a content plan can cause problems that you may not be able to develop your way out of. They know that the people that use the website is what matters and those people need to find what they need and expect it to be in good shape.

前端开发应该关注数据库. The content lives there. The content must be in good shape. The front end developer can only work with what comes out of those databases. The front end developer needs to combine what comes out of those databases with templates to make the website happen.

前端开发应该关注测试. So many kinds! Integration testing. Regression testing. User testing!

前端开发应该关注系统. They might be responsible for implementing a design system, or an icon system, or a coding style guide. They might have to create those systems themselves. They might need to document those systems.

前端开发应该关注运维开发. They are writing and committing code along with every other coder on the project, so they need to adhere to the same setup as everyone else. If they didn't write the build system themselves, they know what it is, what it does, and what it is capable of. If they didn't set up deployment themselves, they know how to use it.

前端开发应该关注服务器. 服务器是一个网站的根本。

前端开发应该关注可访问性. If they aren't well versed in building for accessibility themselves, they know that it's important. They know how to test for it. They know who to talk to about it. They know there is quick wins and long term struggles regarding it.

前端开发应该关注设备使用环境. They know the web is everywhere these days and a good website needs to meet users there. Big screens, little screens, touch screens, far away screens, black and white screens. The front end developer is aware of the unknown.

That's just a handful of the things a great front end developer should be aware of. The more the better.

All this, of course, on top of their own direct job. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, libraries and frameworks, communication... this list is scary-long itself!
